## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to practice the fundamental concepts behind search engines,  
such as indexing, query processing, and basic ranking algorithms.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- Create an **inverted index** from a set of documents (text files).
- Write a **query processor** that can parse user queries and search the index.
- Implement a **ranking algorithm** using **TF-IDF** (term frequency and document frequency).

## 📋 Tasks

1. **Document Indexing**  
   Create an inverted index from a set of documents.

2. **Query Processing**  
   Implement a simple query processor that interprets user queries.

3. **Ranking**  
   Develop a basic ranking algorithm using term frequency and document frequency (TF-IDF).

---

## 🚀 Deliverable

A **Python application using Streamlit**, where users can input queries and get **ranked results** from the document set.
